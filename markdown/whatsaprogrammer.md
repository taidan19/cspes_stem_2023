## What is Code?

* Code is a set of instructions for a computer that tell it what to do
* Code is written in a _programming_ language. There are many different kinds of programming languages

---

## Why do we Need a Special Programming Language?

Why can't we just talk to it like a person?

--

## Computers are different

* Computers can't "think" like you or I can
* They don't have reason or intuition
* They're really good at certain things
  * Like doing math

--

* We have to give them very specific instructions
* In a very specific way
* Programming languages help us do that

---

## Example - Making a Sandwich

## Example - Real Code


---

## What Can We Use Code For?

All sorts of things!!

* Make a game
* Make an app
* Make a website

--

* Do business stuff
* Launch a rocket
* Command a robot

--

* Make drawings and animations
* Create Visual Effects for Movies
* Make music

## How I use STEAM

Programmers have to use a lot of STEAM skills

--

## Algebra

Lots of code looks something like this:

```
y = x + 3
```

Knowing math makes it easier to read and write code

--

## Logic

STEM teaches you how to use logic

Programmers use logic _all_ the time

--

## "Domain Knowledge"

Sometimes programmers have to write code to help to other science

* ie. Code to help a biologist or an astronomer
* It's useful to know understand some of their "domain", AKA it's useful to know a little bit about biology, outer space, etc

--

## The Arts

When you are programming, you spend a lot of time solving problems

It's kind of like solving a puzzle

These puzzles are easier to solve when you have a strong sense of creativity and imagination

---

## Coding is Cool!

Even if you don't want to have a job doing coding, it's a cool skill to have

--

## For Fun

You can use it to make fun games, or express yourself through art

--

## To Help

You can make things that can help you throughout your life

--

## To Solve

You can use it to solve tough problems

---

## Conclusion

Coding is fun!

You need a good STEAM education to learn to code

A good STEAM education is good for everyone
